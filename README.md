# Sign_Speak
Objective: Develop a system that translates sign language into spoken language in real-time.

Components:

Camera: Captures sign language gestures.
Machine Learning Model: Analyzes gestures and translates them into text or speech.
Software Interface: Displays translated text or vocalizes the translation.
Features:

Real-time Translation: Processes gestures quickly to provide immediate translation.
Accuracy Improvement: Uses deep learning to enhance gesture recognition over time.
User Interface: Provides an accessible and intuitive way for users to interact with the system.
Technologies:

Computer Vision: For detecting and interpreting hand gestures.
Natural Language Processing: Converts recognized gestures into coherent text or speech.
Deep Learning: Used for training models to improve gesture recognition accuracy.
Applications:

Communication Aid: Helps individuals who use sign language communicate with those who donâ€™t.
Educational Tool: Assists in learning sign language.
